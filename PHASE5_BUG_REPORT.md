## 🚨 CRITICAL BUGS

### BUG #001: Unauthorized Menu Visibility for Agent Role
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Priority**: P1 - MUST FIX IMMEDIATELY  
**Component**: Navigation System  
**File**: `/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

**Description**: 
Users menu item is visible to agent-role users, allowing them to potentially access user management functionality that should be restricted to admin and management roles only.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Login as user with 'agent' role
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Observe left navigation menu
4. Users menu item is visible when it should be hidden

**Expected Behavior**: 
Users menu should only be visible to users with 'admin' or 'management' roles.

**Actual Behavior**: 
Users menu is visible to all authenticated users regardless of role.

**Root Cause**: 
In `/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`, the navigation filtering logic at lines 47-57 is correctly implemented, but there may be a race condition or timing issue with role loading that causes the menu to render before role verification completes.

**Code Location**:
```typescript
// Lines 47-57 in /app/dashboard/layout.tsx
const getNavigationItems = () => {
  const navigation = [...baseNavigation]
  
  // Add admin/management only items
  if (userProfile?.role === 'admin' || userProfile?.role === 'management') {
    navigation.push(...adminManagementNavigation)
  }
  
  return navigation
}
```

**Proposed Fix**:
1. Add loading state check to prevent premature menu rendering
2. Ensure role-based filtering is properly applied
3. Add additional validation in the navigation component

**Security Impact**: 
HIGH - Agents could potentially access user management interface, view sensitive user data, or attempt unauthorized operations.

**Fix Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Must be resolved before production deployment

## ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY BUGS

### BUG #002: Inconsistent Communication Edit Permissions
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Priority**: P2 - Fix in Next Sprint  
**Component**: Communications Management  
**File**: `/app/dashboard/communications/page.tsx`

**Description**: 
Agents cannot edit their own communications, which creates a usability issue when agents need to correct or update their communication logs.

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Login as agent
2. Navigate to Communications page
3. View communications created by the agent
4. No edit button is visible for own communications

**Expected Behavior**: 
Agents should be able to edit their own communications within a reasonable time window (e.g., 24-48 hours after creation).

**Actual Behavior**: 
Only management and admin users can edit any communications, including those created by the current agent.

**Code Location**:
```typescript
// Line 162 in /app/dashboard/communications/page.tsx
const canEditCommunications = ['management', 'admin'].includes(userRole)
```

**Business Impact**: 
Medium - Agents cannot correct mistakes or update incomplete communication logs, requiring management intervention for simple edits.

**Proposed Solution Options**:
1. **Option A (Recommended)**: Allow agents to edit their own communications within 48 hours of creation
2. **Option B**: Allow agents to edit only non-submitted communications
3. **Option C**: Maintain current behavior but add request-edit functionality

**Recommended Implementation**:
```typescript
const canEditCommunications = (comm: Communication) => {
  if (['management', 'admin'].includes(userRole)) return true;
  
  // Allow agents to edit their own communications within 48 hours
  if (userRole === 'agent' && comm.agent_id === currentUserId) {
    const hoursSinceCreation = (Date.now() - new Date(comm.created_at).getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60);
    return hoursSinceCreation <= 48 && !comm.is_locked;
  }
  
  return false;
}
```

## 🔧 MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES

### BUG #003: Order Status Enum Mismatch
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Priority**: P3 - Fix in Current Sprint  
**Component**: Order Management  

**Description**: 
The order status dropdown includes 'delivered' and 'cancelled' options that are not defined in the database enum type.

**Database Enum**: `'pending' | 'submitted' | 'approved'`  
**Frontend Options**: Includes `'delivered'` and `'cancelled'`

**Impact**: 
Users can select invalid status values that will cause database errors on save.

**Fix Required**: 
Align frontend dropdown options with database enum or update database schema.

---

### BUG #004: Missing Error Handling for RLS Violations
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Priority**: P3 - Fix in Current Sprint  
**Component**: Data Access Layer  

**Description**: 
When RLS policies block data access, users see generic "Error fetching data" messages instead of meaningful feedback.

**Expected Behavior**: 
Users should see appropriate messages like "Access denied" or "Insufficient permissions".

**Fix Required**: 
Implement proper error handling and user-friendly error messages for authorization failures.

---

## 🔍 LOW PRIORITY ISSUES

### BUG #005: Inconsistent Date Format Display
**Severity**: LOW  
**Priority**: P4 - Future Enhancement  
**Component**: UI Display  

**Description**: 
Date formats are inconsistent across different components (some show "MMM d, yyyy", others show "MM/dd/yyyy").

**Fix Required**: 
Standardize date display format across all components.

---

### BUG #006: Mobile Menu Overlay Z-Index Issue
**Severity**: LOW  
**Priority**: P4 - Future Enhancement  
**Component**: Mobile Navigation  

**Description**: 
On some mobile devices, the mobile menu overlay appears behind modal dialogs.

**Fix Required**: 
Adjust z-index values for proper layering.
