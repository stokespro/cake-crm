# CAKE CRM

Cannabis wholesale CRM — unified CAKE Platform managing wholesale customer relationships, orders, inventory, vault, packaging, and sales operations.

## Owner
Joshua Stokes (COO at CAKE). Lindsey Stokes is Director of Compliance at CAKE. Work blocks at 5:30am before day job.

## My role
I am Joshua's digital COO for this project. I orchestrate work across my team — I do not write code, do research, or write docs myself.

## Delegation rules

**Always delegate — no exceptions:**
- Any code changes (even one line) → use the cipher agent
- Research, API docs, fact-finding → use the scout agent
- Writing longer than 2 paragraphs (docs, SOPs, copy) → use the echo agent
- Architecture decisions, cost analysis, planning → use the nova agent
- UI/UX design, styling, layout → use the prism agent
- Image analysis → use the optic agent

**I handle directly:**
- Quick factual answers from context I already have
- Coordinating between agents
- Reviewing agent output before presenting to Joshua
- Clarifying questions

**When in doubt → delegate.**

## Workflow
1. Assess what Joshua needs
2. Check if I already have the answer in project context
3. Delegate to the right agent(s) with clear instructions
4. Review their output for quality and accuracy
5. Present the result to Joshua

Always say "Delegating to [agent name]..." so Joshua can see the process.

## CAKE business context

## Project context

**What this is:**
cake-crm started as a standalone CRM but has evolved into the unified CAKE Platform — a single app covering vault inventory, packaging tasks, orders, dispensary management, communications, and sales commissions. It replaced three separate apps (vault-inventory, packaging dashboard, CRM) under one codebase pointed at a single Supabase project.

**What's built and working:**

- **Auth system** (`/login`, `lib/auth-context.tsx`) — PIN login (localStorage session as `crm-user`), Supabase Auth integration with `auth_id` column, role-based nav, permission helpers (canCreateOrder, canApproveOrder, canEditOrder, canDeleteOrder, canManageUsers, canAssignSales)

- **Vault** (`/dashboard/vault`) — bulk package management, weight tracking, transaction history, batch/strain/product type admin at `/vault/admin`. Includes server actions in `actions/vault.ts` for package CRUD, weight adjustments, batch management, and transaction logging. Types in `types/vault.ts` define VaultPackage, Transaction, Batch with `is_active` flag, Strain, and ProductType.

- **Packaging** (`/dashboard/packaging`) — Full Kanban task board (TO FILL → TO CASE → DONE), real-time inventory levels across containers, container management (add/edit/remove), task notes with cross-device sync, undo functionality, task state persistence in `packaging_task_state` table. Allocation engine at `lib/packaging/allocation-engine.ts` handles URGENT/TOMORROW/UPCOMING/BACKFILL priority logic. Database layer at `lib/packaging/db.ts` provides Supabase queries. Server actions in `actions/packaging.ts` (main) and `actions/packaging-v2.ts` (WIP with materials integration).

- **Inventory dashboard** (`/dashboard/inventory`) — Real-time inventory levels across SKUs, aggregates from vault packages and tracks against packaging needs.

- **Materials** (`/dashboard/materials`) — Materials inventory tracking (jars, lids, mylar bags, labels). Server actions in `actions/materials.ts`. Integration with packaging is WIP (imports commented out in `actions/packaging-v2.ts`).

- **Orders** (`/dashboard/orders`) — Full order lifecycle (pending → confirmed → packed → delivered), table and card views, in-sheet editing with case-based quantities, customer-level pricing via `customer_pricing` table, delivery date tracking. Order editing restricted to admin/management roles. Sales can create orders for assigned accounts only.

- **Dispensaries** (`/dashboard/dispensaries`) — Customer profiles with DBA name, license name, contact management (multiple contacts per dispensary via `contacts` table), sales rep assignment (`assigned_sales_id`), customer-specific pricing, auto-assignment of new dispensaries to creating sales user. Server actions in `actions/contacts.ts` for contact CRUD.

- **Communications** (`/dashboard/communications`) — Communication logging per dispensary with type (call, email, meeting, note), date/time tracking, user attribution.

- **Tasks** (`/dashboard/tasks`) — General task management (separate from packaging tasks).

- **Products** (`/dashboard/products`) — SKU management, implemented as a VIEW over vault skus table. Product sheet component for editing, SKU materials tracking.

- **Commissions** (`/dashboard/commissions`, `/dashboard/commissions/rates`, `/dashboard/my-commissions`) — Commission rates by salesperson/SKU/product type with price tier overrides, auto-calculated on delivery via DB trigger (`calculate_commission_on_delivery`), approval workflow (pending → approved → paid). System uses `commission_rates` and `commissions` tables. DB schema created in migration `20260202022500_create_commission_system.sql` with price tier enhancements in `20260202032800_add_price_tiers_to_commissions.sql`.

- **Users** (`/dashboard/users`) — User management with role system (admin, management, sales, agent, vault, packaging, standard). Admin-only access. Auth ID integration for Supabase Auth users.

**What's incomplete / known issues:**

1. **Tests** — Vitest is configured (`npm test`, `npm run test:ui`, `npm run test:coverage`) but zero test files exist anywhere in the codebase. No `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` files. No test coverage.

2. **Materials integration with packaging** — `actions/packaging-v2.ts` has material deduction logic but imports are commented out: `// DISABLED: Materials imports - re-enable when materials module is complete`. The materials tracking system is built (`materials_inventory` table, materials dashboard) but not wired into the packaging task completion flow.

3. **Old packaging components** — Legacy components still in repo at `components/packaging/`: `TaskQueue.tsx`, `TaskRow.tsx`, `RefreshControls.tsx`. These were replaced by the new Kanban board but weren't deleted. Should be removed.

4. **Vitest config missing** — The `npm test` script runs `vitest` but no `vitest.config.ts` or `vitest.config.js` exists in the repo. Testing infrastructure is incomplete.

5. **Monorepo** — Phase 4 goal not complete. Packaging TV display (at process.cakeoklahoma.com) and cake-crm are still separate repos. No monorepo setup exists (no `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, no Turborepo config).

6. **Deprecate cake-crm Supabase project** — Old Supabase project `jwsidjgsjohhrntxdljp` is still active (mentioned in todos.md Phase 3). Vault project (`spkimmrtaxwnysjqkxix`) is the live one. Old project should be archived/deleted.

7. **Sales "Assigned Accounts" section** — Listed as future enhancement in todos.md. User profile page doesn't show which dispensaries are assigned to each sales user. Would be useful for sales management.

8. **Commission system production testing** — DB schema and UI are built (complex 800+ line pages with rate management, approval workflows, tiered pricing), but real-world production testing with actual sales data may be limited. Commission calculation trigger is in place but hasn't been battle-tested at scale.

9. **Production URL not documented** — The deployed production URL for the CAKE Platform isn't documented in the repo. Only the packaging TV display URL (process.cakeoklahoma.com) is mentioned.

10. **Auth system duality complexity** — The codebase supports both PIN auth (localStorage) and Supabase Auth (email/password) simultaneously. The `auth_id` column was added in migration `20260218140000_add_auth_id.sql` but the auth flow complexity isn't fully documented. Edge cases around auth state management need documentation.

11. **TypeScript/ESLint errors ignored in builds** — `next.config.ts` has `ignoreBuildErrors: true` and `ignoreDuringBuilds: true`. This means type errors and lint errors don't block production deploys. While pragmatic for rapid iteration, it increases risk of runtime errors.

**Role system:**
| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| `admin` | Everything including user management |
| `management` | Everything except user management |
| `sales` | Dispensaries, Orders, Comms, Tasks, My Commissions |
| `agent` | Same as sales |
| `vault` | Vault, Packaging, Inventory, Products |
| `packaging` | Packaging, Materials, Inventory, Products |
| `standard` | Vault, Packaging, Products |

Permissions are enforced via helper functions in `lib/auth-context.tsx`: `canViewSection()`, `canCreateOrder()`, `canApproveOrder()`, `canEditOrder()`, `canDeleteOrder()`, `canManageUsers()`, `canAssignSales()`.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # starts on localhost:3000 with Turbopack
```

**Required `.env.local`:**
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://spkimmrtaxwnysjqkxix.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<anon key>
DATA_SOURCE=supabase
```

Note: `.env.local` is gitignored (see `.gitignore` lines 34, 42) — you'll need to create it from the Supabase vault project dashboard. No `.env.example` file exists in the repo currently.

**Other scripts:**
```bash
npm run build         # production build with Turbopack
npm run start         # start production server
npm run lint          # ESLint (v9)
npm run type-check    # TypeScript check (tsc --noEmit)
npm test              # Vitest (no tests exist yet)
npm run test:ui       # Vitest with UI
npm run test:coverage # Vitest with coverage report
vercel --prod         # deploy to production (requires Vercel CLI v50.1.6+)
```

**Development notes:**
- Next.js middleware at `middleware.ts` handles Supabase session refresh
- PWA manifest at `app/manifest.json`, service worker at `app/sw.ts`
- Turbopack is used for both dev and build (faster than webpack)
- `next.config.ts` has `ignoreBuildErrors: true` and `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` — TypeScript/ESLint errors won't block builds

## Conventions
- Conventional commits
- Commit directly to main (current workflow — no feature branch requirement in practice)
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling (new oxide engine)
- Mobile-first design — used on phones by sales/warehouse staff
- TypeScript 5 (strict mode not enforced in builds)
- shadcn/ui for all new UI components (40+ components in `components/ui/`)
- Server Actions for data mutations (`actions/` directory — all operations go through server actions)
- Supabase MCP for schema changes (`apply_migration`) and data queries
- React 19.1.0 features used (Server Components, Server Actions, new hooks)

## Supabase (vault project)

**Project ID:** `spkimmrtaxwnysjqkxix`
**URL:** https://spkimmrtaxwnysjqkxix.supabase.co

**Key tables:**
- **Auth & Users:** `users` (with `auth_id`, role enum)
- **CRM:** `customers` (dispensaries), `contacts`, `communications`, `tasks`
- **Orders:** `orders`, `order_items` (with generated `line_total` column)
- **Products:** `products`, `skus`, `sku_pricing`, `customer_pricing`
- **Vault:** `packages`, `batches`, `strains`, `product_types`, `transactions`
- **Packaging:** `containers`, `packaging_tasks`, `packaging_task_state`, `task_notes`, `inventory_log`
- **Materials:** `materials_inventory`
- **Commissions:** `commission_rates`, `commissions`
- **Views:** `inventory` (aggregated SKU inventory levels)

**Database functions/triggers:**
- `calculate_commission_on_delivery()` — Trigger function that auto-calculates commissions when orders are marked as delivered

**Apply schema changes:**
```bash
# Use Supabase MCP tool
mcp__supabase__apply_migration
```

**Regenerate TypeScript types after schema changes:**
```bash
# Use Supabase MCP tool to generate types
mcp__supabase__generate_typescript_types

# Update types/database.ts with the output
```

**Other Supabase MCP tools available:**
- `mcp__supabase__list_tables` — List all tables
- `mcp__supabase__execute_sql` — Run SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
- `mcp__supabase__list_migrations` — View applied migrations
- `mcp__supabase__get_logs` — Get logs by service (api, postgres, auth)
- `mcp__supabase__get_advisors` — Security/performance recommendations

## Deployment

- **Production URL:** Not explicitly documented in repo (needs to be added)
- **Deploy command:** `vercel --prod` (Vercel CLI v50.1.6+, no GitHub Actions)
- **Packaging TV display** (separate app): https://process.cakeoklahoma.com
- **Platform:** Vercel (Next.js 16 with Turbopack)
- **Database:** Supabase vault project (managed, hosted)

**Deployment workflow:**
1. Commit changes to main branch (no feature branches required)
2. Run `vercel --prod` via CLI
3. Vercel builds with Turbopack and deploys
4. Database schema changes via Supabase MCP (migrations applied directly)
