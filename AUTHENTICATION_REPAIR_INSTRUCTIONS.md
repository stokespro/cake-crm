# 🚨 CRITICAL: Authentication System Repair Instructions

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

The authentication system has been diagnosed and repaired, but **database changes must be applied manually** to complete the fix.

### 🔧 Step 1: Apply RLS Policy Fixes (CRITICAL)

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**: Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to SQL Editor**: In your project dashboard
3. **Execute RLS Fixes**: Copy and paste the entire content from `supabase/rls-policy-fixes.sql`
4. **Run the Query**: This will fix the circular dependency in admin policies

### 👑 Step 2: Promote User to Admin Role

1. **In Supabase SQL Editor**: Execute the content from `supabase/promote-admin-user.sql`
2. **Verify Email**: Make sure to replace `'stokes@cakeoklahoma.com'` with your actual email
3. **Check Result**: The query should return "Successfully promoted [email] to admin role"

### 🧪 Step 3: Test the Repairs

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Hard refresh the application (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Login to Application**: Go to https://cake-crm.vercel.app
3. **Check Profile Page**: Should load without errors and display your admin role
4. **Check Sidebar**: Should show your actual email and "Admin" role
5. **Test Admin Features**: 
   - Go to Dispensaries → Should see "Add Dispensary" button
   - Go to Products → Should see "Add Product" button
   - Profile updates should work without errors
